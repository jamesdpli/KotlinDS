# Call Stack

### <ins>Explanation</ins>
1) When you run a program your computer uses a Stack data structure when deciding what tasks to execute
2) Each function is added to the stack along with its variables, when the function completes it is popped off 
the top of the stack]
3) New functions are pushed to the top of the stack
4) If the stack gets to large you get a stack overflow exception
5) All function calls go onto the call stack
